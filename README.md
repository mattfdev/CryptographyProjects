# cps713

The code includes all of the requirements with the exception of the following:
  - No clear delineanation is made between encryption and decryption; Both functions are executed at once and the outputs for both are produced
  - No ciphertext-sealing was implemented
  - The executable does not read from the command-line (though whether this is an actual requirement is not obvious, as the wording on the pdf is ambiguous.).
