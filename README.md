# CryptologyProjects

Various cryptology projects made for university course CPS713 Applied Cryptology.

- Demonstrates the design and usage of OpenSSL libraries to create, modify, and compare md5 hashses, demonstrate the one way, and strong collision cryptographic hash properties

- Rudimentry implementation of simplified "Light" DES encryption, which encrpyts a file specified in a similar but simplier fashion to standard DES

- Utilize OpenSSL library to utilize public/private key encrptions on a file, and demonstrate the usage of diffrent block cipher algorithms (ECB, CBC, CFB, and CTR)
