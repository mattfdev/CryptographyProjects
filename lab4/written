Lab 4

Suppose Bob solves the puzzle at index j of the puzzle array P. According to the way that the protocol is described,
Bob would communicate j in clear-text back to Alice over an insecure communication channel.
Eve would then be able to intercept j and decrypt the j'th puzzle with the key 0...0j. It ought to be the case that Bob
communicates encrypt(secret_j,j) instead of j. This way, instead of Eve simply brute-forcing P[j], she does not
know which index is encrypted, thus necessitating a brute-force on every index and then encrypting the index with
the found key until she happens to find the one that Bob communicated to Alice. Because Bob picked a number at random,
he only needs to brute-force one index.

The key here is that Bob has to brute force significantly less digits than Eve does to find the key. For less important,
or time dependant messages, this encryption scheme significantly reduces the risk of information turnover, or atleast
reduces the value of the message.
